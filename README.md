# Business AR 
### A smarter way of promoting products using AR technology <br/>
<p>Marketing, Promoting and Advertising is one of the major concerns for any company
in the real world, a company always wanted to showcase 
their product in an unique way so that customers could easily been attractable and 
every company wanted a poignant storytelling tool to advertise their product. <br/>
<p>Our idea is to integrate a mobile based platform (Mobile Application) using augmented reality for efficient promotion, 
marketing and advertisement of products in shopping malls and all other places where advertisement is sought for,
though there are many ways to promote and solve the issues for customers, 
our application stand aside from traditional way of marketing, the people will have a connectivity to virtual world, 
and at the same time the company will have a powerful backend for customer segregation and management.
